# quick-scope
A Vim plugin that highlights which characters to target for <kbd>f</kbd>, <kbd>F</kbd> and family. **No mappings are needed**.

*Check out [character motions](#character-motions) to learn about what these keys do and their advantages. See [other motions](#other-motions) for alternative ways of moving across a line and their use-cases.*

**TLDR**: This plugin should help you get to any word on a line in two or three keystrokes with mainly <kbd>f&lt;char&gt;</kbd> (which moves your cursor to <kbd>&lt;char&gt;</kbd>).

## Overview
When moving across a line, the <kbd>f</kbd>, <kbd>F</kbd>, <kbd>t</kbd> and <kbd>T</kbd> motions combined with <kbd>;</kbd> and <kbd>,</kbd> should be your go-to options for [many reasons](#advantages). Quick-scope fixes their only drawback: it is difficult to consistently choose the right characters to target.

### Features
+ Quick-scope highlights the first occurrences of characters to the left and right of your cursor (**green** in the screencast), once per word, everytime your cursor moves.

+ If a word does not contain a first occurrence of a character but contains a second occurrence of a character, that character is highlighted in another color (**blue** in the screencast).

+ Quick-scope takes extra measures to avoid bombarding you with superfluous colors:
  + It ignores special characters since they are easy to eye and tend to only appear once or twice on a line.

  + By default, it samples colors from your active color scheme for its highlighting.

### Benefits
+ Highlighting is done automatically.
  + You already know what character to target before pressing any keys.
  + No more guesswork or slowing down to reason about the character motions.
+ This plugin neither introduces new motions nor overrides built-in ones.
  + You don't have to learn any new commands or mappings.
  + This helps you to become a better user of vanilla Vim.

## Installation
Use your favorite plugin manager.
```vim
" Your .vimrc

Plug 'unblevable/quick-scope'       " Plug
NeoBundle 'unblevable/quick-scope'  " xor NeoBundle
Plugin 'unblevable/quick-scope'     " xor Vundle
```
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/unblevable/quick-scope ~/.vim/bundle/quick-scope # xor Pathogen
```

## Options
### Highlight on key press
```vim
" Your .vimrc

" Trigger a highlight in the appropriate direction when pressing these keys:
let g:qs_highlight_on_keys = ['f', 'F', 't', 'T']

" Trigger a highlight only when pressing f and F.
let g:qs_highlight_on_keys = ['f', 'F']
```

### Customize colors
```vim
" Your .vimrc

if has("gui_running")  || has('termguicolors') || has('nvim') && $NVIM_TUI_ENABLE_TRUE_COLOR " gui vim or vim enable TrueColor
    let g:qs_first_occurrence_highlight_color = '#ffffff'
    let g:qs_first_occurrence_highlight_bgcolor = '#CD0000'
    let g:qs_second_occurrence_highlight_color = '#ffffff'
    let g:qs_second_occurrence_highlight_bgcolor = '#447e27'
else " terminal vim
    let g:qs_first_occurrence_highlight_color = 15
    let g:qs_first_occurrence_highlight_bgcolor = 28
    let g:qs_first_occurrence_highlight_color = 15
    let g:qs_second_occurrence_highlight_bgcolor = 205
endif
```

### Toggle highlighting
Turn the highlighting on and off with a user command:
```
:QuickScopeToggle
```
Or create a custom mapping for the toggle.
```vim
" Your .vimrc

" Map the leader key + q to toggle quick-scope's highlighting in normal/visual mode.
" Note that you must use nmap/vmap instead of their non-recursive versions (nnoremap/vnoremap).
nmap <leader>q <plug>(QuickScopeToggle)
vmap <leader>q <plug>(QuickScopeToggle)
```

## Moving Across a Line
This section provides a detailed look at the most common and useful options for moving your cursor across a line in Vim. When you are aware of the existing tools available to you and their tradeoffs, you can better understand the benefits of this plugin.

### Character motions

I unofficially refer to <kbd>f</kbd>, <kbd>F</kbd>, <kbd>t</kbd>, <kbd>T</kbd>, <kbd>;</kbd> and <kbd>,</kbd> as the **character motions**. They form your swiss army knife for moving across a line:

#### Advantages
+ The motions are easy to reason about. Simply choose a character and then move your cursor to it. (And with quick-scope, the best characters to choose are always identified for you.)
+ They are versatile. You can usually move your cursor to any word on a line in a single motion.
+ Yet they are also precise. You specify an exact location to move your cursor.
+ The key combinations are quick to execute and efficient in terms of number of key presses. It should only take 2 or 3 key presses to move your cursor to where you want it to be.
+ The <kbd>f</kbd> key in particular sits comfortably on home row of the keyboard.
+ Vim includes a set of two dedicated keys, <kbd>;</kbd> and <kbd>,</kbd>, just to make it easier to repeat the character motions and offset bad character targets.

#### Reference
*You can also consult Vim's excellent help docs for information about any command using `:h <command>`.*
```
f<char> moves your cursor to the first occurrence of <char> to the right.

fg
It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus.
^ > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > ^

```
```
F<char> moves your cursor to the first occurrence of <char> to the left.

Fl
All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter,
         ^ < < < < < < < < < < ^
```
<kbd>t</kbd> and <kbd>T</kbd> can be just as useful. Notice how <kbd>tf</kbd> is the most optimal way to reach the word `off` in the example below.
```
t<char> moves your cursor right before the first occurrence of <char> to the right.

tf
while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV.
      ^ > > > > > > > > > ^
```
```
T<char> moves your cursor right before the first occurrence of <char> to the left.

Ts
But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns.
                                       ^ < < < < ^
```
The character motions can take a preceding `count`, but in practice, Vim users tend to use the <kbd>;</kbd> and <kbd>,</kbd> to repeat a character motion any number of times.
```
; repeats the last character motion in the original direction.

fa;;
And also he got a racecar.
^ > ^
And also he got a racecar.
    ^ > > > > > ^
```
```
, repeats the last character motion in the opposite direction.

fs,
Is any of this getting through to you?
   ^ > > > > ^
Is any of this getting through to you?
 ^ < < < < < ^
```

### Other motions
+ Note that many of Vim's motions can take a preceding `count`, e.g. <kbd>2w</kbd> moves your cursor two words to the right. However, in most cases I would advise you **not** to use a `count`:
  + The number keys tend to be awkward to reach.
  + It is silly to waste time counting things before using a motion.
  + There are probably more effective ways to get to where you want in one or two keystrokes anyway (usually with <kbd>f</kbd> and co. or simply by repeating the motion).

+ <kbd>b</kbd>, <kbd>B</kbd>, <kbd>w</kbd>, <kbd>W</kbd>, <kbd>ge</kbd>, <kbd>gE</kbd>, <kbd>e</kbd>, <kbd>E</kbd>

  The word motions. They are usually the optimal choices for moving your cursor a distance of one or two words. (See `:h word` for Vim's definition of a word.) Take advantage of the fact that some of these keys ignore special characters or target the beginning or end of words.

+ <kbd>0</kbd>, <kbd>^</kbd>, <kbd>$</kbd>

  These keys let you skip to the beginning or end of a line. They are especially useful for repositioning your cursor for another motion on long lines.

  You might want to map <kbd>0</kbd> to <kbd>^</kbd> because <kbd>^</kbd> tends to be the preferred functionality but <kbd>0</kbd> is easier to reach.
  ```vim
  " Your .vimrc

  " Move across wrapped lines like regular lines
  noremap 0 ^ " Go to the first non-blank character of a line
  noremap ^ 0 " Just in case you need to go to the very beginning of a line
  ```

+ <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>l</kbd>

  Try to avoid spamming these keys at all costs, but bear in mind that they *are* the most optimal ways to move your cursor one or two spaces.

+ <kbd>?</kbd>, <kbd>/</kbd>

  The search keys. They are overkill for moving across a line.
  + Much of their behavior overlaps with that of the superior character motions.
  + <kbd>/</kbd> + `pattern` + <kbd>Return</kbd> amounts to a wildly inefficent number of keystrokes.
  + Searches pollute your buffer with lingering highlights.

+ <kbd>(</kbd>, <kbd>)</kbd>

  These keys let you move across sentences. (See `:h sentence` for Vim's definition of a sentence.) They can also be convenient when working with programming languages that occasionally have `!` or `?` at the end of words, e.g. Ruby and Elixir.
